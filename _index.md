    <p class="mb-0">Mautic began with a single focus. Equality. The Mautic Community believes in giving every person the power to understand, manage, and grow their business or organisation. Mautic is focused on helping this belief become a reality by getting powerful Open Source marketing automation software into the hands of everyone.</p>

    <p>When David Hurley (@dbhurley) began Mautic he had a big goal. A plan to move horizons, and change the world.</p>
    <p>He foresaw Mautic as software made by the people and for the people and as such the community became a top priority and integral part.</p>
    <p>Those people interested in becoming involved in a community with a vision to change the world should consider getting involved in Mautic. People are the priority. Equality is the goal.</p>
